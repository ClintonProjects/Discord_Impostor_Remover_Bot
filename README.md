# Running Maven Fat JAR through CMD Guide (set up)

Replace the discord token in the Java file (in the main class). Build the project using Maven. Open the project folder. Navigate to the "target" directory. Open the command prompt (CMD) in the file directory. Run the following command: 

```shell
java -jar -Dapple.awt.UIElement="true" Impostorbot-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -h
```

**Note**:
Make sure you have Java 8 installed.

This command launches the application using the Maven Fat JAR, with the specified Discord token and additional arguments.

I will update this at a later date to be more advanced.

Just want to note, the note database was a design choice and will come in more use later on during project development. The project was designed to be used by less technical people, and expecting them to set up a database is a bit much.
